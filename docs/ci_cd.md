# CI/CD Integration Guide

This guide provides an overview and step-by-step instructions for integrating automated unit test execution, static analysis tools, and continuous integration (CI) with GitHub Actions in Python repositories.

## 1. Automated Unit Test Execution

Automated unit tests help ensure code quality and catch regressions early. To integrate automated unit test execution:

- **Choose a test framework:** Common choices are `pytest` and `unittest`.
- **Organize your tests:** Place test files in a `tests/` directory and use naming conventions like `test_*.py`.
- **Run tests locally:**
  ```bash
  pytest
  # or
  python -m unittest discover
  ```
- **Add requirements:** List test dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.

## 2. Static Analysis Tools

Static analysis tools help maintain code quality and style. Popular tools include:

- **Flake8:** Checks for style and programming errors.
- **Pylint:** Provides detailed code analysis and suggestions.
- **Black:** Automatically formats code to a consistent style.

**Example installation:**

```bash
pip install flake8 pylint black
```

**Example usage:**

```bash
flake8 your_package/
pylint your_package/
black --check your_package/
```

## 3. Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions can automate testing and analysis on every push or pull request.

**Example workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):**

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install flake8 pylint black pytest
      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: flake8 your_package/
      - name: Lint with pylint
        run: pylint your_package/
      - name: Check formatting with black
        run: black --check your_package/
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

## 4. Setting Up Test Automation

1. **Write tests** in the `tests/` directory using your chosen framework.
2. **Add a requirements file** (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) listing all dependencies.
3. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow** as shown above.
4. **Push your code to GitHub.** The workflow will run automatically on each push or pull request.
